    "paragraph1": "We started with a simple question: why is online booking so complicated? When we connected the first form to a restaurant, we realized that booking is just the tip of the iceberg. The links between bookings, POS, kitchen, inventory, accounting and reports were missing.",
    "paragraph2": "That's how EasyReserv was born: an All-in-One platform that brings everything together — bookings and waitlist, fiscal POS, orders & KDS, inventory & recipe costing (COGS), real-time reports and automation. We built it for real teams, with go-live in days, not months, integration with 1C and payments, without changing hardware.",
    "paragraph3": "Today we optimize operations in diverse industries: restaurants and cafes, beauty salons & barbershops, hotels & guesthouses, car rentals, fitness & wellness, medical and retail. Our mission remains the same: fewer systems, fewer errors, better decisions on real data – so you sell more and your team works smarter."
